1	I have been working on this Medication Reminder System project for over a week. Although it hasn’t exceeded 24 hours, I’ve definitely put in focused effort and gone beyond the minimum required hours.
2	My program is structured into multiple functions, each designed to do a specific task. This makes the code modular and easy to maintain.
3	I’ve made significant progress on the project and just completed a good portion of the core features. That’s why my answers in this submission may differ from earlier ones.
4	Function Names in the Main Program (medication_reminder.py):
• create_csv_file()
• add_medication()
• view_medications()
• (Planned: set_reminder(), send_reminder(), save_data(), load_data(), main())
5	Test Function Names in the Test File (test_medication_reminder.py):
• test_create_csv_file()
• test_add_medication()
• test_view_medications()
6	Resources Used:
• Python documentation on csv and datetime
• Pytest documentation for testing
• YouTube tutorials on writing tests, mocking input, and using CSVs in Python
7	Coding Experiments:
• Practiced using unittest.mock.patch to simulate user input
• Used StringIO to capture output from functions
• Worked with file setup and cleanup during testing
8	Work Completed:
• Built the add_medication() function to collect and save medication info to a CSV
• Built the view_medications() function to read and display data from the CSV
• Wrote and passed test cases for all three main functions
• Ensured my code is ready for the next step: implementing time-based reminders and saving/loading data automatically
